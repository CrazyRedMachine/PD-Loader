PD Loader Tools for AMD Compatibility
=====================================

Use the files here to patch your shaders to work (with Novidia) on AMD GPUs.

Instructions:
  1. Copy amd-tools and plugins folders to your game directory.
  2. Run "patch shaders" from amd-tools. This may take several minutes.
     **WARNING** This will overwrite shader.farc from existing MAMD mdata!
